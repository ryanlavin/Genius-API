Idea:
- Full-stack application that utilizes HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend & Go for backend and server handling
- Starts with user-authenticated encrypted register/login that stores login info in MySQL database
- Accessing a database that stores lyrics scraped from Genius, stores lyrics in database of artists discography
- Tracks which songs of an artist's discography have been read through and learned
