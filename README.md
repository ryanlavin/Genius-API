Idea:
- Full-stack applicationt that utilizes JavaScript & Go
- Starts with user-authentication with encrypted register/login that stores login info in database (probably MySQL)
- Starting a go server (using own authentication, not OAUTH2)
- Accessing a database that stores lyrics scraped from Genius, stores lyrics in database of artist's discography maybe?
- Tracking which songs of an artist's discography have been read through and learned
